What do you call a programming party? `git bash` :trollface:

Hi! :wave: My name is **Mykhaylo**, and I like dad jokes and JavaScript.

Here to learn, and help others in any way that I can. My main interest and area of expertise lies with front-end development (with focus on **React** specifically at this time), however lately I've also started to branch out to **React Native** in personal projects.

You can find me on:
