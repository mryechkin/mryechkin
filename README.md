What do you call a programming party? `git bash` :trollface:

Hey :wave:

My name is **Mykhaylo**, and I like dad jokes and JavaScript.

I'm a software engineer @ Manulife, and my focus is web development (primarily "front-end"). Currently enamored by `NextJS` and all things `Tailwind` (I've drank the koolaid, lol)

In my spare time you'll find me either playing or listening to music, video gaming, or snapping photos on my Sony DSLR. Lately I've also taken a liking to creating content, and have started sharing it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWS51MbLHKtzEmYLtExyshQ)
