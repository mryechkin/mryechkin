What do you call a programming party? `git bash` :trollface:

Hey :wave:

My name is **Mykhaylo**, and I like dad jokes and JavaScript.

I'm a software engineer @ Manulife, with focus primarily on front-end on all things web. Currently I'm leading development of an internal React component library for use within Manulife and John Hancock.

In my spare time you'll find me either playing or listening to music, gaming, or snapping photos on my Sony camera. I've also recently started creating content, and sharing what I learn on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWS51MbLHKtzEmYLtExyshQ).
